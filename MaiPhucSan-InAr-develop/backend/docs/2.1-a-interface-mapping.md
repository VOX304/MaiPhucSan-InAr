# Assignment 2.1-a — Interface Mapping (from 1.2 to REST)

This short note documents **how the interface from Assignment 1.2** (salesmen + social performance)
is mapped to a REST API (used by 2.1‑b,c). It complements the OpenAPI YAML.

## Business entities
- **Salesman** (core identity used across systems)
- **SocialPerformanceRecord** (one per _salesman_ **per year**) with a list of **GoalScore** items

## Endpoint table (table-based spec)
| Use case (from 1.2)                              | REST Endpoint                                 | Method | Notes |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| List all salesmen                                | `/api/v1/salesmen`                             | GET    | Optional filter `?q=` on name/email |
| Get single salesman by id                        | `/api/v1/salesmen/{id}`                        | GET    | `id` is a short string (e.g., `"90123"`) |
| Create salesman                                  | `/api/v1/salesmen`                             | POST   | Body includes `firstName`, `lastName`, … |
| Update salesman                                  | `/api/v1/salesmen/{id}`                        | PUT    | Full/partial update |
| Delete salesman (demo/local only)                | `/api/v1/salesmen/{id}`                        | DELETE | For local demo/reset in 2.1‑c |
| List performance records (optionally filtered)   | `/api/v1/performance`                          | GET    | Filter by `?salesmanId=&year=` |
| Create social performance record                  | `/api/v1/performance`                          | POST   | **One record per (salesmanId, year)** |
| Update performance record                        | `/api/v1/performance/{id}`                     | PUT    | Edit goals/remarks |
| Delete performance record (demo/local only)      | `/api/v1/performance/{id}`                     | DELETE | For local demo/reset in 2.1‑c |
| List performance for one salesman                | `/api/v1/salesmen/{id}/performance?year=YYYY` | GET    | Handy for UI/detail views |

## Data shapes (summarized)
- `Salesman`: `{ id, firstName, middleName?, lastName, email?, hireDate?, department?, supervisor? }`
- `GoalScore`: `{ goalId, description, valueSupervisor (1..5), valuePeerGroup (1..5) }`
- `SocialPerformanceRecord`: `{ id, salesmanId, year, goals: GoalScore[], remarks? }`

> **Constraint**: Only one social performance record per **salesman per year** (enforced in controller).
